- 👋 Hi, I’m @Robert856414
- 👀 I’m interested in Creating Vertual Machines Starting With The Best OS Windows 98 Second Edition!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning How To Use 86Box!
- 💞️ I’m looking to Get My First Vertual Machine To Work But No luck! Why Isn't This Working For Me?
- 📫 I Just Get Error Messages That Say The Drives Are Not Compatable Why?
- You Can Reach Me At rburlin425@gmail.com That Is My E Mail Adderess!
- The PC Im Using Is A Windows 7 32 Bit OS PC With An Intel Pentium 4 4 Core Processor The Brand Is Lenovo!
- The Vertual Michine Is Supposed To Be A Windows 98 Second Edition Machine But For Whatever Reason It Is Failing!
- Im Trying To Fix It But I Don't Know How Can Some One Please Help Me?

- Here Is What I Allready Know About The Best OS!
- It Does Not Install On Machines With A CPU That Has More Then One Core Or Too Much Memory
- It Can't Be Installed From A DVD Drive Unless Its Allready Installed On The Hardware Or On A Vertual Machine And It Will Not Install On Machines With USB Devices Pluged Into Them!

- Thank You For Your Time!
